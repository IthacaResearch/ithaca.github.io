# Notes
- Returns are total returns, that is, the backtests assume no withdrawals, and that all distributions (such as dividends) are reinvested in the strategy
- All backtests include the simulation of commissions and slippage, while bid-ask spreads are not taken into account
- A strategy might be compared for convenience to a benchmark. In such a case, the S&P 500 index has been chosen as benchmark
