## FAQs

**How are returns calculated?**<br>
Returns are total returns, that is, the backtests assume no withdrawals, and that all distributions (such as dividends) are reinvested in the strategy.

**How realistic are the backtest results?**<br>
All backtests account for transaction fees and slippage, while bid-ask spreads are not taken into account. Orders are always fully filled.

**What is the benchmark displayed in some of the strategies results?**<br>
The benchmark is the S&P 500 index.

**Can the strategies be combined together?**<br>
Absolutely, that is actually how we are currently using them. Please contact us at info@ithacainvestments.org if you'd like to review the results of a specific combination of strategies and/or to receive updates for a specific combination.

**Can you provide the trade logs of the backtests?**<br>
Yes, they are available upon request.

**Can you provide further details about the strategies' inner workings?**<br>
We cannot provide the source code of the strategies. However, we can provide the references (our own research notebooks, papers, books, websites) that have inspired the creation of a specific strategy upon request.
