# Notes
- Returns are total returns, that is, the backtests assume no withdrawals, and that all distributions (such as dividends) are reinvested in the strategy
- All backtests account for transaction fees and slippage, while bid-ask spreads are not taken into account. Orders are always fully filled
- A strategy might be compared to a benchmark for convenience. In such a case, the benchmark is the S&P 500 index
