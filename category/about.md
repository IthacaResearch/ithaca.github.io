Systematic investment strategies have several advantages over discretionary ones:
1. investment decisions are not based on emotions
2. the key elements of an investment plan are clearly defined and acted upon: entry criteria, exit criteria, maximum and minimum exposure
3. the actual results can be easily compared to the expected results
4. the investment process can be fully automated
5. it is possible to simulate the strategies using past data to get an idea of the strategy's characteristics
