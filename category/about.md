> _There is no favorable wind for the sailor who doesnâ€™t know where to go_ - Seneca

Not long after starting my first job after graduating, I gladly understood I was quite good at saving: after paying for my monthly expenses and not having debts to repay, I could move a sum with two (trailing!) zeros to my savings account.

Not having plans to buy an apartment in the foreseeable future, and remembering my grandfather saying "stashing money means losing money", I wondered where I could put my savings other than in my savings account. I therefore started searching the internet; not having found something that looked reliable, I gave a chance to its predecessors, something I had learned to rely on during my studies: books.

I found out soon that books were not as encouraging as I had hoped. The books I was used to had a common denominator: determinism. Much of what I had studied ended up in neat formulas that, however complicated, described the underlying physical phenomenon in a reassuringly static way, the best snapshot of the truth humans could have grasped so far. Even when uncertainty was introduced by real world scenarios, it was only a deviation from the formulas, that continued to hold no matter what.
The books I was reading for my new endeavour couldn't have been further from that: truth, by definition unique, was not readily available. I was left with a feeling of incompleteness and guilt, the one I had as a student when taking an exam knowing I hadn't had time to prepare well enough on this or that topic.

I had to gain confidence before moving my savings, more specifically confidence from a statistics' point of view: what were the chances I could lose more than 10 % of my savings? What were the chances I could lose more than 20 %? Was I comfortable with this possible loss?
Although I had had to deal with statistics as an engineer, I was only now beginning to fully appreciate it: it could not only help you in gauging uncertainty on the basis of something certain, but also in gauging uncertainty of uncertainty. Finally confident in my measures of uncertainty, I started moving my money from my savings to mutual funds first, and to exchange traded funds (ETFs) later.

I have found these years' journey so interesting that I'd like it to be my main one. Although I'm good at saving, I'm far from being able to dedicate myself exclusively to the research of investment strategies. I still wanted to move in this direction though, and I realized it was possible when I've found a kindred spirit to share the efforts with.

We have also ultimately decided to publish _Ithaca_, the pool of investment strategies we developed to invest our savings, and start a campaign on Patreon: [patreon.com/ithaca](https://www.patreon.com/ithaca "Go to Patreon page")
