## Execution
To execute the strategies you need to have a brokerage account (some banks provide also brokerage services). The available brokers vary from country to country, as well as the functionalities they provide, the fees they charge, and the products you can trade through them.

We use [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com).
