The details of all our strategies are public. To receive live updates with the latest allocations please subscribe to one of the plans available on Patreon: [patreon.com/ithaca](https://www.patreon.com/ithaca "Go to Patreon page")

To execute the strategies you need to have an account at a broker (or at a bank that provides brokerage services). The available brokers vary from country to country, as well as the functionalities they provide, the fees they charge, and the products you can trade through them.

We use [Interactive Brokers](www.interactivebrokers.com).
