The rationale of this strategy is based on the following hypothesis: on a monthly timescale, global equity markets either go up or down. This is obviously not true, but it is an approximation that is good enough to understand if we should allocate our capital to risky assets or to safe assets. The strategy takes a conservative approach: if it doesn't know what to do, it switches to safe assets.

The main advantage of this strategy is the ability to limit big losses while harvesting returns when equity markets are stable.
