> _Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget rule No. 1._ - Warren Buffett

The rationale of this strategy is rather simple: allocate most of the capital to safe assets (like cash or bonds) when times get rough, otherwise allocate more to risk assets (in this case stocks).

The main advantage of this strategy is low risk: although it sacrifices some returns, the maximum drawdown since 1987 is less than 6%.

Strategy updates are available to all Patrons.
