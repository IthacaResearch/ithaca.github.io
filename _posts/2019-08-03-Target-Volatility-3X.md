> _Nothing ventured, nothing gained_

The rationale of this strategy is the same of the un-leveraged _Target Volatility_: allocate most of the capital to safe assets (like cash or bonds) when times get rough, otherwise allocate more to risk assets (in this case stocks).

The advantage of this variant of _Target Volatility_ is higher returns: the usage of variable leverage allows to compensate for the lower returns earned during periods when the strategy is invested mostly in safe assets.

The main risks of this strategy are high leverage and unforeseen changes in correlations between risk assets and safe assets.
